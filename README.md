# Loan data from Lending Club

## Business Problem:
Lending Club managers need to make good lending decisions based on the right loan grade.
* What are the most important features in grade classification?
* What are the most important features in defaulting loans? 
* Particularly which features help greatly hedge the risk of the lender? 



## About Dataset
Data set represents thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals. Of course, not all loans are created equal. Someone who is a essentially a sure bet to pay back a loan will have an easier time getting a loan with a low interest rate than someone who appears to be riskier. And for people who are very risky? They may not even get a loan offer, or they may not have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate. It is important to keep that last part in mind, since this data set only represents loans actually made, i.e. do not mistake this data for loan applications!
